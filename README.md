Additionally, it will copy params.py to this folder, so it's easy to tell which

Please, before running again, rename the Results folder, else it won't work.

The default board size is 100 by 100 and the board is not visualised.
This is because this board is too large to print in a terminal.
To visualize the board change this to a 25 by 25 board, also comment in lines 19, 21 and 22 in main.py.
Also change the sleep duration in line 19 to a prefered duration.
