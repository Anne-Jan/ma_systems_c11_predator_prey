All variables are stored in params.py
Use this file to change variables, please do not change any variables in other files.

Program stores results for a number of runes in a folder called "Results".
Additionally, it will copy params.py to this folder, so it's easy to tell which
parameters were used to obtain these results.

Please, before running again, rename the Results folder, else it won't work.
